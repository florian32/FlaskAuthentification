# FlaskAuthentification
The project has been made during the 100 days of code course. And uses Flask and SQLAlchemy to authenticate users on a website.

## How does it work?

The project uses SQLAlchemy and Flask to save the data from the user, the password is then being hashed using werkzeug.security. If the user is logged in he can download a file from the website.
